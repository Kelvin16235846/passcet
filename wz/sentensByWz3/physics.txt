{"eg":"1. According to physics, the force of gravity between two objects is directly proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.2. In physics, the concept of time dilation explains how time appears to pass slower for objects in motion relative to those at rest.3. The laws of thermodynamics in physics dictate that the total energy in a closed system remains constant, but the transfer of energy from one form to another results in a decrease in the amount of usable energy.","eng":"physics"}
