{"eg":"1. In the quiet of the night,The stars whisper their secrets bright,And the moon casts its silver light.2. The leaves rustle in the gentle breeze,The birds chirp sweet melodies in the trees,And nature's beauty brings me to my knees.3. Love is a flame that burns bright,Through the darkness and the light,It warms our hearts and makes life right.","eng":"poem"}
